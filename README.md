## Free Code Camp - Weather API (Angular 4)

See it in action here: https://beesmart.github.io/fcc-weatherAPI/

An Angular 4 app which uses HTML5's Geolocation data to grab a weather report for your area. It also allows switching the temperature value between Celsius & Farenheit.

It's a project which is inspired by FCC's project map: https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-the-local-weather
I originally built it in jQuery but wanted to try it out in Angular...

## Setup

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
